# Six Stats
Six Stats is a python based web scraping project that gets player statistics from https://game-rainbow6.ubi.com/en-us/home for the popular game Rainbow Six Siege. It automates the login process and the navigation of the webpage to simply show the user the desired statistics in the console

## Motivation
The idea for this project came from joking with friends about who was better at the game. As I had just learned the basics of web scraping from a school project I thought it would be fun to make a program that could "tell" us who was better.

## Code Style
This code is written to follow the PEP 8 guidelines
